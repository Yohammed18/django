# Django Project

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is used to build web applications efficiently, with an emphasis on reusable components, scalability, and security.

## Key Features of Django

1. **MVC Architecture**: Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern (referred to as MTV: Model-Template-View in Django terms), ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
2. **Built-in ORM**: Django includes a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system to interact with databases without writing raw SQL.
3. **Admin Interface**: Automatically generated admin panel for managing application data.
4. **Security**: Django includes protections against common security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
5. **Scalability**: Django supports high-traffic web applications and is optimized for performance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- pip (Python package manager)
- A database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other supported options)
